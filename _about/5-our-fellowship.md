## Christian Fellowship Ministries
The Door Church of Maricopa is proud to be part of a global Fellowship of churches.

Christian Fellowship Ministries began in 1970 as a single church in Prescott, AZ. From that small local church, applying the simple Biblical principles of evangelism, discipleship, church planting, and world evangelism, was birthed a revival movement. Today over 3,500 churches through over 100 nations and almost every state of the USA are part of this movement, with dozens of new churches planted every year. However, the vision of the Fellowship remains unchanged: to see the entire world won for Jesus Christ!

The leadership church of our Fellowship remains The Potter’s House of Prescott, AZ. Our relationship to the Prescott Potter’s House through our mother church in Tempe has been a great blessing.

## Our Mother Church

The Door Church of Maricopa is a pioneer church planted by The Door Christian Fellowship of Tempe in 2021.

The Door in Tempe was launched out of The Potter's House of Prescott, AZ in 1976, with a vision to win not only Tempe but the whole world to Jesus Christ. In over 45 years of ministry, the Tempe church and its descendants have reached cities and nations around the world. The fruitfulness of this vision in giving, prayer, sending, and partnership is already clear, but the full impact will only be measured in eternity. Tempe now has over 65 churches throughout the United States and in several foreign nations.

Our relationship with our mother church and pastor in Tempe brings the following benefits:

- Accountability to and guidance from a veteran pastor and leadership structure
- A partnership in prayer with faithful saints in Tempe and around the world
- The opportunity to be a part of something much bigger than ourselves
- A pattern of ministry that has proven to be fruitful and replicable
