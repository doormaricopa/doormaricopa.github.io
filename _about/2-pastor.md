Pastor Kevin was radically saved in 2006 and has been all in for Jesus ever since. He met Shar, the love of his life, in church in Tempe, AZ, where she was also radically saved (actually, on the exact same day!) They were married in 2009 and now have three wonderful children. 

Kevin & Shar were discipled and trained for ministry in their mother church in Tempe, including twice serving on the ministry staff as outreach director. They also pioneered a church in Meridian, ID. They are excited to see the church grow as they have set down roots here in Maricopa.
