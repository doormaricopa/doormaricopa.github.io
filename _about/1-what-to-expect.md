We are a local church plant with a worldwide vision. We share a cozy storefront space as we continue to grow. When you enter the building you will come into our sanctuary where we have cold water waiting.

Our worship services are Pentecostal in nature, featuring music, praise, Bible-based preaching, ministry and prayer for personal needs. Services generally run around 1 hour. We welcome everyone and we're always willing to pray for healing or any other need.

We love having families worship with their children in our services. However, we also offer child care for smaller children who are unused to a church setting.
