We are a new, small church plant with a large heart. Right now we're holding services in two schools while we look for a permanent location.

We love having children in our services but child care for smaller children who are unused to a church setting is available.

Our worship services are Pentecostal in nature, featuring music, praise, Bible-based preaching, ministry and prayer for personal needs. Services generally run around 1 hour. We welcome everyone and we're always willing to pray for healing or any other need.
