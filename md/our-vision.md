# Our Vision

# Fellowship Principles
The Door Church of Maricopa is proud to be part of a global Fellowship of churches with a global vision and principles. We're not trying to reinvent the faith; what we do is based on the timeless teaching of God's Word.

## Evangelism
The Gospel taken outside the four walls is the absolute foundation of our church, in obedience to the Great Commission. We emphasize personal evangelism, and a large variety of outreaches to share the Gospel.

And He said to them, ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature'… (Mark 16:15)

## Conversion
We witness, testify and preach for a decision to surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord. The Gospel has the power to save and transform lives. The majority of our congregation consists of people converted here by the power of God.

… having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever… (1 Peter 1:23)

## The Local Church
God has placed everything necessary to accomplish His will in the setting of the local church. God’s will is accomplished in and through us as we connect with and commit ourselves to a local church.

…the church. Which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way. (Ephesians 1:22-23)

## Discipleship
God intends for His calling to be accomplished through being trained and equipped within the setting of a local church. Therefore, the highest calling of a pastor and congregation is to obey Christ’s command in the Great Commission.

Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. (Matthew 28:19-20)

## Church Planting & World Evangelism
From the earliest Bible record, God’s vision is worldwide testimony and impact. The gospel message and the vision God has revealed to us is not simply American, but God-inspired; so therefore it works, and is relevant in every nation and culture of the world. Our job as believers, and as the local church is to pray, train, invest, send and support workers to go into all the world!

Although we are a new church plant, our aim is to one day send workers from Maricopa into cities and nations around the world. In the meantime, we partner with our mother church in Tempe to help support their church planting and missionary endeavors.

Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matthew 9:37-38)
