## What To Expect
<span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/expect.jpg" alt="" /></span>
We are a new, small church plant with a large heart. Right now we're holding services in two schools while we look for a permanent location.

We love having children in our services but child care for smaller children who are unused to a church setting is available.

Our worship services are Pentecostal in nature, featuring music, praise, Bible-based preaching, ministry and prayer for personal needs. Services generally run around 1 hour. We welcome everyone and we're always willing to pray for healing or any other need.

## Pastor Kevin Teeling
<span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/pastor.jpg" alt="" /></span>
Pastor Kevin was radically saved in 2006 and has been all in for Jesus ever since. He met Shar, the love of his life, in church in Tempe, AZ, where she was also radically saved. They were married in 2009 and now have three wonderful children. 

Kevin & Shar were discipled and trained for ministry in their mother church in Tempe, including twice serving on the ministry staff as outreach director. They have also pastored in Meridian, ID and are thrilled to pioneer a church plant in Maricopa.

## Fellowship Principles
The Door Church of Maricopa is proud to be part of a global Fellowship of churches with a global vision and principles. We're not trying to reinvent the faith; what we do is based on the timeless teaching of God's Word.

### Evangelism
The Gospel taken outside the four walls is the absolute foundation of our church, in obedience to the Great Commission. We emphasize personal evangelism, and a large variety of outreaches to share the Gospel.

> And He said to them, ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature'… (Mark 16:15)

### Conversion
We witness, testify and preach for a decision to surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord. The Gospel has the power to save and transform lives. The majority of our congregation consists of people converted here by the power of God.

> … having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever… (1 Peter 1:23)

### The Local Church
God has placed everything necessary to accomplish His will in the setting of the local church. God’s will is accomplished in and through us as we connect with and commit ourselves to a local church.

> …the church. Which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way. (Ephesians 1:22-23)

### Discipleship
God intends for His calling to be accomplished through being trained and equipped within the setting of a local church. Therefore, the highest calling of a pastor and congregation is to obey Christ’s command in the Great Commission.

> Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. (Matthew 28:19-20)

### Church Planting & World Evangelism
From the earliest Bible record, God’s vision is worldwide testimony and impact. The gospel message and the vision God has revealed to us is not simply American, but God-inspired; so therefore it works, and is relevant in every nation and culture of the world. Our job as believers, and as the local church is to pray, train, invest, send and support workers to go into all the world!

Although we are a new church plant, our aim is to one day send workers from Maricopa into cities and nations around the world. In the meantime, we partner with our mother church in Tempe to help support their church planting and missionary endeavors.

> Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matthew 9:37-38)

## Statement of Faith
#### We believe these things:
<div class="box">
There is only one God, and He is eternally existent in Three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
</div>
<div class="box">
God the Father is the Creator of the universe. He created man in His own image for fellowship, and called man back to Himself through Christ after the rebellion and fall of man.
</div>
<div class="box">
Jesus Christ, the Son, is eternally God. He was together with the Father and the Holy Spirit from the beginning, and through Him all things were made. He left Heaven and became incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary; henceforth, He is forever one Christ with two natures—God and man—in one Person.
</div>
<div class="box">
The Holy Spirit is God, the Lord, and giver of life, who was active in the Old Testament, and given to the Church in fullness at Pentecost. He empowers the saints for service and witness, cleanses us from the old nature, and conforms us to the image of Christ.
</div>
<div class="box">
The baptism in the Holy Spirit with evidence of speaking in tongues, subsequent to conversion, releases the fullness of the Spirit, and is further demonstrated by the fruits and gifts of the Holy Spirit.
</div>
<div class="box">
The Bible containing the Old and New Testament is the only infallible and inspired Word of God. Its authority is ultimate, final, and eternal. It cannot be added to, subtracted from, or superseded in any regard. The Bible is the source of all doctrine, instruction, correction, and reproof. It contains all that is needed for guidance in godliness and practical Christian conduct.
</div>
<div class="box">
Christ's vicarious death on the cross paid the penalty for the sins of the whole world. The benefits of healing (body, soul, and spirit) are provided for in the atonement as well.
</div>
<div class="box">
Salvation is a free gift of God, based on the merits of the death of His Son, and is appropriated by faith. Salvation is affected by personal repentance, belief in the Lord Jesus (justification), and personal acceptance of Him into one's life as Lord and Savior (regeneration).
</div>
<div class="box">
The Christian life is to be one of consecration, devotion, and holiness. The shortcomings of the individual are because of the still progressing sanctification of the saints. The Christian life is filled with trials, tests, and warfare against a spiritual enemy. For those abiding in Christ until their deaths or His return, the promises of eternal blessing in the presence of God are assured.
</div>
<div class="box">
The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God among the saints through the Spirit. Every believer born of the Spirit has a place in the church designated by God. The church is called to be a place where Christ is working in the lives of the believers and calling ministers to the great commission to go into all the world and make disciples of every nation.
</div>
<div class="box">
The Lord has given us the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Baptism is the outward sign of what God has already done in the individual's life and is a public testimony that the person now belongs to Christ. It is identifying with the death and resurrection of Jesus and is done in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Lord's Supper is a commemoration of the death of the Lord and is done in remembrance of Him until He comes again; it is a sign of our participation in Him.
</div>
<div class="box">
Jesus Christ will personally and bodily return in His second coming. After this will come the resurrection of the saints, the millennium, and the final judgment. The final judgment will determine the eternal status of both the saints and the unbelievers, determined by their relationship to Jesus Christ.
</div>

## Our Fellowship
### Christian Fellowship Ministries
The Door Church of Maricopa is proud to be part of a global Fellowship of churches.

**Christian Fellowship Ministries** began in 1970 as a single church in Prescott, AZ. From that small local church, applying the simple Biblical principles of evangelism, discipleship, church planting, and world evangelism, was birthed a revival movement. Today over 3,500 churches through over 100 nations and almost every state of the USA are part of this movement, with dozens of new churches planted every year. However, the vision of the Fellowship remains unchanged: to see the entire world won for Jesus Christ!

The leadership church of our Fellowship remains **The Potter’s House of Prescott, AZ**. Our relationship to the Prescott Potter’s House through our mother church in Tempe has been a great blessing.

### Our Mother Church

The Door Church of Maricopa is a pioneer church planted by **The Door Christian Fellowship of Tempe** in 2021.

The Door in Tempe was launched out of The Potter's House of Prescott, AZ in 1976, with a vision to win not only Tempe but the whole world to Jesus Christ. In over 45 years of ministry, the Tempe church and its descendants have reached cities and nations around the world. The fruitfulness of this vision in giving, prayer, sending, and partnership is already clear, but the full impact will only be measured in eternity. Tempe now has over 65 churches throughout the United States and in several foreign nations.

Our relationship with our mother church and pastor in Tempe brings the following benefits:

- Accountability to and guidance from a veteran pastor and leadership structure
- A partnership in prayer with faithful saints in Tempe and around the world
- The opportunity to be a part of something much bigger than ourselves
- A pattern of ministry that has proven to be fruitful and replicable
